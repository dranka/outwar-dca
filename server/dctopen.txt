Stay tuned for more updates. Any areas unmapped still let me know. Only things that should be left unmapped are any paid areas. If you want those mapped contact me after you do a run before you leave area and I can do it through trustee.

Thanks everyone who gave feed back and bugs in the map and who lent me trustee access to make the map more complete.

Turned off the Debug menu and removed a tab from the quest pannel that was not yet coded.

Feel free to send suggestions and ideas that you would like in future updates to dranka@fuckplayingfair.com

This is the version of typpo that I (Dranka) will be working on and trying to get up to date. Everything should be the same from the corruptsource one. I lost access to that server and have no way to update so this is the next best option.

I am going to need accounts to update map data with. If you would like to help please contact me via email at dranka@fuckplayingfair.com.
